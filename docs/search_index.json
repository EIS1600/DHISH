Possible Issues: Both R and RStudio may refuse to install if your computer and operating system is too old. For example, in late 2022, this was an attested problem with a MacBook Air 2015 with the MacOS High Sierra 10.13.6. Possible Solutions: you should try to update your operating system. This, however, might be not possible if your hardware does not support newer operating systems. you can try to install older versions of both R and Rstudio, but you must be prepared to face problems every step of the way later on. Not the ideal solution. well, if nothing works, you may have to bite the bullet and get a new computer. "],["using-projects.html", "3.2 Using “Projects”", " 3.2 Using “Projects” Projects are a very convenient feature of RStudio. The idea is very simple—Rstudio ties all settings to a specific folder, which makes it much easier to work with files kept in the same folder. How to use projects? create a folder somewhere on your computer; let’s call that folder “My_First_R_Project”, for further reference; move files that you are going to work with into that folder; open RStudio, then, in the main menu, choose: File &gt; New Project (you should then see “New Project Wizard”, as shown below); Select “Existing Directory” &gt; then click on “Browse”, and then select the folder “My_First_R_Project”, which you created in the first step; click “Create Project” to complete the process. Now, what will happen is that in the tab “Files” in the lower right part of RStudio you will see the contents of the folder “My_First_R_Project”. There will also be a new file, called “My_First_R_Project.Rproj”. Later on, you will be able to quickly open your project by double-clicking on that file. When you open te project, R automatically sets the working directory (setwd()) to the folder of the project and many things just become much easier. Now, you can add and create new files relevant to your project in the folder “My_First_R_Project” and they will be easy to find directly from RStudio, using its “Files” Tab, which is usually available in the lower right corner. Suggestion: you will benefit greatly from keeping some order in your project folder. For example, keep all you data files in a subfolder “data”; your images in a subfolder “images”, and so on.

The original worksheets have been developed by Lincoln Mullen (https://dh-r.lincolnmullen.com/worksheets.html). The ones used in this class might have undergone some changes and relevant adaptations. Your R installation may ‘speak’ your main language. It is nice on one hand, but can be quite inconvenient in class, where the main language is English. You may have to do cast some spells to switch R into English.

Generate the results into HTML or PDF (PDF is a little bit trickier). Start working through the first assigned course in DataCamp (two weeks to complete; requires about 4 hours) Submit your homework as described below. 3.3.7 Common issues with homework 3.3.7.1 Tracing errors Errors happen all the time. You will run into errors when you run your code. You will run into error messages when “knitting” your document — as a result, your document will not be generated. To resolve this: It is important to run each chunk of code separately to ensure that they all work. If any of the chunks throw errors, you will not be able to “knit” your documents. When you run into an error, R Markdown panel (usually in the lower left corner of RStudio interface) will tell you in which line the error occurred. You will need to fix it the same way you would in Step 1. 3.3.7.2 Comments / Commenting out You do not want to constantly keep [re]installing libraries. So, if a library is already installed, you can “comment out” that line. install.packages(&quot;gapminder&quot;) install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) For example, the code chunk above should become: #install.packages(&quot;gapminder&quot;) #install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) Adding # in front of a line (or a section of a line) turns it into a comment and it will not longer be executed. 3.3.7.3 Random errors: Think about the following two lines of code.

For this purpose, R uses library tesseract, which required Tesseract software to be installed on your computer. You can find detailed instructions here (Warning: this part may be a little bit annoying, but Tesseract is a useful software to have and to know how to use.) Here is some R code that should get you started on using Tesseract (For more details, check the information page): Preparations: library(tesseract) ##LANGUAGEDATA: &lt;https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/langdata&gt; tesseract_download(&quot;eng&quot;) # this needs to be done only once tesseract_download(&quot;deu&quot;) # this needs to be done only once Converting an image into a text: pngPage &lt;- &quot;Sample_Page_With_Tabular_Data_Morris.png&quot; text &lt;- tesseract::ocr(pngPage, engine = tesseract(&quot;eng&quot;)) readr::write_lines(text, str_replace(pngPage, &quot;.png&quot;, &quot;.txt&quot;)) Converting a PDF into a text: library(pdftools) # for processing PDFs pdfPages &lt;- &quot;Morris_2013_Combined.pdf&quot; pngFile &lt;- pdftools::pdf_convert(pdfPages, dpi = 600) text &lt;- tesseract::ocr(pngFile, engine = eng) readr::write_lines(text, str_replace(pdfPages, &quot;.pdf&quot;, &quot;.txt&quot;)) NB: Here is a great video tutorial on how to use Tesseract with R (including an Arabic example), by Samer Hijjazi: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfhFpZ_vabI. 5.2.5 Main format Relational databases or Tables/Spreadsheets (tabular data)? Tabular format: tables; spreadsheets; CSV/TSV files. Unique identifiers: tables with different data can be connected via unique identifiers Note: A relational database (rDB) is a collection of interconnected tables. Tables in an rDB are connected with each other via unique identifiers which are usually automatically created by the database itself when new data is added. One can maintain interconnected tables without creating a rDB: Linked Open Data (or, Linked Local Data, when you create and maintain a dataset of your own.). Example: Table of the growth of cities. One table includes information on population over time; Another table includes coordinates of the cities from the dataset. It is more efficient and practical (reducing error rate from typos) to work on these tables separately, and connect them via unique identifiers of cities which are used in both tables. 5.2.5.1 Note on the CSV/TSV format CSV stands for comma-separated values; TSV — for tab-separated values. Below is an examples of a CSV format. Here, the first line is the header, which provides the names of columns; each line is a row, while columns are separated with , commas. city,growth_from_2000_to_2013,latitude,longitude,population,rank,state New York,4.8%,40.7127837,-74.0059413,8405837,1,New York Los Angeles,4.8%,34.0522342,-118.2436849,3884307,2,California Chicago,-6.1%,41.8781136,-87.6297982,2718782,3,Illinois Houston,11.0%,29.7604267,-95.3698028,2195914,4,Texas Philadelphia,2.6%,39.9525839,-75.1652215,1553165,5,Pennsylvania TSV is a better option than a CSV, since TAB characters (\\t) are very unlikely to appear in values. Neither TSV not CSV are good for preserving new line characters (\\n)—or, in other words, text split into multiple lines/paragraphs. As a workaround, one can convert \\n into some unlikely-to-occur character combination (for example, ;;;), which would be easy to restore into \\n later, if necessary. 5.2.6 Basic principles of organizing data: Tidy Data 5.2.6.1 Tidy Data Each variable is in its own column Each observation is in its own row Each value is in its own cell Source: Wickham, Hadley, and Garrett Grolemund. 2017. R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data. Sebastopol, CA: O’Reilly UK Ltd. https://r4ds.had.co.nz/; for a Chapter on tidy data, see: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html. 5.2.6.2 Clean Data Column names and row names are easy to use and informative. In general, it is a good practice to avoid spaces and special characters. Good example: western_cities Alternative good example: WesternCities Bad example: Western Cities (only the largest) Obvious mistakes in the data have been removed Date format: YYYY-MM-DD is the most reliable format. Any thoughts why? There should be no empty cells: If you have them, it might be that your data is not organized properly. If your data is organized properly, NA must be used as an explicit indication that data point is not available. Each cell must contain only one piece of data. Variable values must be internally consistent Be consistent in coding your values: M and man are different values computationally, but may be the same in the dataset; Keep track of your categories: a document where all codes used in the data set are explained. Preserve original values If you are working with a historical dataset, it might be inconsistent. For example, distances between cities are given in different formats: days of travel, miles, farsaḫs/parasangs, etc.). Instead of replacing original values, it is better to create an additional column, where this information will be homogenized according to some principle. Keeping original data will allow to homogenize data in multiple ways. Clearly differentiate between the original and modified/modelled values. The use of suffixes can be convenient: Distance_Orig vs Distance_Modified. Most of editing operations should be performed in software other than R; any spreadsheet program will work, unless it cannot export into CSV/TSV format. Keep in mind that if you prepare your data in an Excel-like program, rich formatting (like manual highlights, bolds, and italics) is not data and it will be lost, when you export your data into CSV/TSV format. Note: It might be useful, however, to use rule-based highlighting in order, for example, to identify bad values that need to be fixed. Back up your data! http://github.com is a great place for this, plus it allows to work collaboratively as well as to keep track of all changes. Google spreadsheets is a decent alternative for collaborative work, but it lacks version control and detailed tracking of changes. 5.2.7 In Class II: Practical 5.2.8 Morris Dataset: the East Vs. the West War-making capacity since 4000 BCE (in social development points).

Fix the dataset so that it conforms to the principles of tidy data. What should be corrected? The datasets for the East and the West are separate. What would be your strategies to combine them? Graph chronological changes in war-making capacities for the East and the West. When the East was in the lead? What were the most prominent settlements? When the West was in the lead? What were the most prominent settlements? How can you determine that?

Your task will be to collect data on 23 viennese districts: 1) numbers of houses; 2) numbers of inhabitants. This information is available on pages of each district. You can find them at the following links: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. To get to the data that we need, you will need to click on the link with the actual name of the district. There you will find a detailled description of the district and one of the sections will contain statistics on houses and the inhabitants of the district. Your task will be as follows: to collect this data into tables (CSV files) that will be organizes according to the principles of tidy data; there are 23 districts and 13 students; each one of you will need to collect data on two districts (treat this not as a torture, but as an exercise); please, pick your districts here (write in your name against two districts that you want to pprepare); as always, you are welcome to work collaboratively (there still must be two districts per person though); you are encouraged to use the strategies that we discussed in class and come up with your own (for example, you can carefully retype the data from graphs; but you can also look for the source of this data; both strategies are perfectly fine). in your homework notebook: load the data that you have collected; print out the tables (they are rather small, so print them in full); generate graphs of growth of houses and inhabitants; email CSV files together with your notebooks. 5.2.10 Reference Materials Wickham, Hadley. 2014. “Tidy Data.” Journal of Statistical Software 59 (10). https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v059.i10.

The focus of the course is on geospatial analysis. The course will have three main parts: first, you will be introduced to the basics of R; second, you will learn about main geospatial methods; third, you will work on your own research project. The language of the course is English. Just to give you an idea, these are some examples of visualizations that result from the application of analytic methods, which will be covered in the course.

Your computer must run a full version of either Windows, MacOS, or Linux; unfortunately, neither tablets nor Chrome-based laptops are suitable for this course. No prior programming experience is required, but familiarity with the command line and basic principles of programming will be beneficial. Course Evaluation Course evaluation will be a combination of: in-class participation (30%), weekly homework workbooks (25%), DataCamp courses (25%), and the final project (20%). Final projects can be prepared either individually or in groups. DataCamp This class is supported by DataCamp, the most intuitive learning platform for data science and analytics. Learn any time, anywhere and become an expert in R, Python, SQL, and more. DataCamp’s learn-by-doing methodology combines short expert videos and hands-on-the-keyboard exercises to help learners retain knowledge. DataCamp offers 350+ courses by expert instructors on topics such as importing data, data visualization, and machine learning. They’re constantly expanding their curriculum to keep up with the latest technology trends and to provide the best learning experience for all skill levels. Join over 6 million learners around the world and close your skills gap. You should all get access to DataCamp for the duration of the semester. If you cannot access it, please, contact me as soon as possible. DataCamp Class Participation Each class session will consist in large part of practical hands-on exercises led by the instructor. BRING YOUR LAPTOP! We will accommodate whatever operating system you use (Windows, Mac, Linux), but it should be a laptop rather than a tablet. Don’t forget that asking for help counts as participation! Homework Just as in research and real life, collaboration is a very good way to learn and is therefore encouraged. If you need help with any assignment, you are welcome to ask a fellow student. If you do work together on homework assignments, then when you submit it please include a brief note (just a sentence or two) to indicate who did what. NB: On submitting homework, see below. Final Project Final project will be discussed later. You will have an option to build on what we will be doing in class, but you are most encouraged to pick a topic of your own. The best option will be to work on something relevant to your field of study, your term paper or your thesis.
